DIY Project Database Application

Background
Welcome to the DIY Project Database Application! In this project, you'll be immersing yourself in the development of an application designed to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on a MySQL database.

What it does?
The application allows users to interact with a DIY Project database, shedding light on many SQL and JDBC intricacies. By the end of this journey, you'll be equipped with the skills required to manage databases in a real-world scenario.

What you've accomplished so far:
Successfully connected to a MySQL database using JDBC.
Diagrammed the project tables using Draw.io.
Authored the CREATE TABLE SQL statements for five distinct tables.
Established these tables in DBeaver.
This week's focus:
For this week, you'll be building the core of the applicationâ€”a menu-driven interface. By focusing on best practices, you will:

Develop a robust menu to facilitate user operations.
Handle unexpected issues with proper exception management.
Integrate functionalities to enrich project tables with relevant details.
Upcoming Features:
In the ensuing sessions, anticipate working on:

Retrieving details from isolated tables and amalgamated ones.
Implementing functionalities to modify and erase table entries.
Objectives
During this exercise series, your aims are to:

Menu-Driven Application: Master the development of a menu-driven application, ensuring errors are managed seamlessly.
User Input: Incorporate a scanner to capture user inputs directly from the console.
BigDecimal Mastery: Dive deep into working with BigDecimal objects, a fundamental skill when dealing with precise numeric values.
JDBC Resource Management: Understand and implement the best practices when handling JDBC resources like Connections and PreparedStatements. It's crucial to ensure these resources are closed aptly to prevent memory leaks.
Database Interactions: Harness JDBC to introduce a Project object into the project table.
Dive in, and good luck with your DIY Project Database Application!
